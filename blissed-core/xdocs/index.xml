  <section name="Overview">
    <p>
    <code>blissed</code> is a very small framework to assist in
    the creation, management and execution of processes and states.
    </p>

    <p>
    <code>blissed</code> is not intended to be useful on its own,
    but rather may support a larger workflow system.  To allow it to
    be easy to integrate with other projects, a 
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/sandbox/jelly/">Jelly</a>
    tag library is provided.

  <section name="Concepts">

    <p>
    <code>blissed</code> is effectively a state-machine framework.
    A state-machine typically models some sort of process, from the
    business process of approving a loan to the lower-level process
    of matching a string of characters against a regular-expression.
    Each state represents an activity to be performed.  Each state
    may have multiple transitions, or directed links, to other states.
    The transitional links may be guarded so as to only open under
    certain circumstances.
    </p>

    <p>
    <code>blissed</code> has direct representations of processes,
    states and transitions by the way of the 
    <a href="apidocs/com/werken/blissed/Process.html" target="api">Process</a>,
    <a href="apidocs/com/werken/blissed/State.html" target="api">State</a>
    and
    <a href="apidocs/com/werken/blissed/Transition.html" target="api">Transition</a>
    classes.
    Each <code>Transition</code> may be guarded by an implementation of
    the <a href="apidocs/com/werken/blissed/Guard.html" target="api">Guard</a>
    interface.
    </p>

    <p>
    There may be several instances of a process occuring simultaneously,
    each within a different context.  A loan application may be considered
    the context of a process instance, as might a string of characters to
    be matched against a regular-expression.
    <code>blissed</code> provides a 
    <a href="apidocs/com/werken/blissed/Context.html">Context</a> class for
    maintaining the context of a given process instance.
